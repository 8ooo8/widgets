This document provides **tips on alleviating or solving a plan execution problem caused by a boring feeling** on the tasks.

## Tips

One of the solutions is **forcefully pushing yourself to work**. 

However, it is **not the first priority** since (1) to most people, keep pushing themselves hard is very difficult, (2) performance and productivity will possibly be dropped as time goes and (3) hardly enter the [flow state][flow-wiki], which can significantly boost the productivity.

Instead, **learning to enjoy the tasks is recommended**.

One of the reasons **why people feel bored with a task is that they are used to it**. 

Therefore, one of the solutions is **making yourself no longer having a negative feeling on the tasks, but instead having a positive feeling**. First, get yourself out of the negative emotion and do not immerse yourself in it. Second, explore the enjoyable parts of the tasks and immerse yourself in them. For instance, an [RPG game][rpg-wiki] lover may treat himself or herself as his or her RPG game character and treat a productive time plan execution as a level up of his or her character. The key is to **explore and immerse yourself in the enjoyable parts and try to reduce or forget about the negative parts**. If you can keep doing this for a long period, the feeling you are used to having for the tasks will be changed gradually and in the end, you will not procrastinate by a boring feeling.

To successfully execute the plan, you may also need **tricks** such as:

- keep **reminding yourself that you just accustom to feel bored and this can be changed** so that it is easier to get rid of the boring feeling;
- use a **signal to quickly pull yourself out from gaming or other entertainment**, e.g. imagine in a sports competition a count down followed by a starting shot to turn yourself into a serious mode and stop the entertainment;
- use **something to distract yourself from a time-consuming entertainment, then forget about that entertainment and back to work**. The **distraction source has to be attractive to you but may only grab your attention for a short while**, e.g. people who like rhythmic stuff may imagine a short and rhythmic video clip to shift their attention from gaming to the clip and then try to get back to work as the video ends;
- **focus on the negative part of excessive entertainment**, e.g. remind yourself of the large amount of time gaming takes away;
- give yourself **a bit positive mental feedback as you make a bit of achievement** to provide energy in keeping it on, e.g. praise yourself;
- make use of **[meditation]**, etc.

The effectiveness of the tricks varies with different people. Go seek the tricks that best fits you and wish you a productive life. :)
